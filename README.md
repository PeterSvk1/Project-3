# Project 3: My battleship game

This is simple game where you can play against the computer.Player board is generated according to player input and ships are assigned randomly to computer and player.
Computer generates random guess and player can choose where to hit.
I hope users will enjoy this functionality and and find it relaxing to play, users have nothing to lose other than their mind if they lose too many times.
